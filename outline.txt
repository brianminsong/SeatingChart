*** referencing the sample image

3 sections

1st section: Header
- will have cwru emblem and text on upper left
- centered application title "seating chart"


2nd section: left hand nav
- 2 dropdown sections (will use MUI dropdown componenet)
    - professor
    - class
- Radio selector for sort BY
    - first, last
    - last, first
- Below scrollable window with student tags
    - image
    - name (presented as either first, last or last, first)


3rd section: classroom and seats
- dropdown selector to pick what classroom is being selected
- bottom right button to download image of the classroom
    - how? idk yet, and what format? idk yet



Logic used:
given inputs professor and class, pull a list of students (which will contain their image, as well as name)
for each student in the list
map it into a div section which will be a draggable object

given a classroom input, it will put a list of where the seats are that correpond to that classroom
    - will have to make a classroom for each class


index has the app
app has the home component which should have everything contained


heirarchy

home will have everything packaged



logic:

entire page is the dndcore section thing
sidebar should map each student into a draggable object.
    draggable object will have photo, and student name
    probably some id for the case id?
the main area for now should just be a grid I can put stuff in

find a way to capture the screen

later on:
each classroom will have mapped out json objects of each of the div locations, rotation, etc
given a selected classroom, it will load that json object of droppable components

this looks like a good example to map with a unique ID
